Herschel’s Guide merges technology and local businesses with a rewards-based game.

Goal: Get more tourists and/or locals into Birmingham’s favorite brick-and-mortar establishments.

Why: As Birmingham, Ala., grows, we want local businesses to leverage tech to become better engaged with customers, while also growing their business/local economy.
